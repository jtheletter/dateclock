# Date Clock

Analog layers of date and time. An holistic horologe of cyclic progression.

Originally sketched in 2009:

<img src="sketches/dateclock-sketch-1.jpg" width="122px" height="128px" title="Click to view larger." alt="Thumbnail image of sketch."> &#xa0; <img src="sketches/dateclock-sketch-2.jpg" width="92px" height="128px" title="Click to view larger." alt="Thumbnail image of sketch.">

Soon thereafter I created a print version in Illustrator: http://calendardial.info/

Motion version is developed here.
