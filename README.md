# Date Clock

Analog layers of date and time. An holistic horologe of cyclic progression.

Originally sketched in 2009:

<img src="sketch1.jpg" width="122px" height="128px" title="click to view larger" alt="thumbnail"> &#xa0; <img src="sketch2.jpg" width="92px" height="128px" title="click to view larger" alt="thumbnail">

Soon thereafter I created a print version in Illustrator: http://calendardial.info/

Motion version is developed here.
